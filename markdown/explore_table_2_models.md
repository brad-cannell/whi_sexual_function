Step 2: Compute odds of sexual satisfaction (Table 2).
------------------------------------------------------

Conduct adjusted models to examine cross-sectional odds of sexual satisfaction (Global/frequency), with sequential modeling as described below. Use multiple imputation to account for the missingness of chronic disease information. Sequential modeling as follows:

**Model 1 (Sociodemographics):**
\* Age
\* Race & Ethnicity
\* Education
\* Income
\* Marital Status
\* WHI study component

**Model 2 (Health/health risk factors + Model 1):**
\* All Model 1 variables
\* Pack years of smoking
\* Body mass index (BMI)
\* Hysterectomy ever
\* Urinary incontinence ever
\* Hypertension ever (variable label = hypt; self-report Form 30)
\* Cardiovascular disease ever (variable label = CVD; self-report Form 30)
\* Arthritis ever (Label = arthrit; self-report Form 30)
\* Cancer ever (Label = canc\_f30; Form 30)
\* Diabetes ever (Variable label = diab & diabtrt; self-report Form 2)
\* Hip fracture age 55 or older (Variable label = hip55; self-report Form 30)
\* Self-rated health
\* Depressive symptoms
\* Current use of SSRI

**Model 3 (Menopausal symptoms/treatment variables that impact menopausal + Model 1 +Model 2):**
\* All Model 1 variables
\* All Model 2 variables
\* Night sweats
\* Hot flashes
\* Vaginal dryness
\* Current use of female hormone therapy

Step 3: Investigation of interaction â€“ does abuse type matter?
--------------------------------------------------------------

For the full sample, investigate whether there is an interaction of abuse type on sexual satisfaction. This will inform how we do subsidiary analyses/format what was Table 3.

Step 4: Sensitivity Analyses:
-----------------------------

We would like to talk to you when you get to this point, so that we are all on the same page.
