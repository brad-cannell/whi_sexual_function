## Introduction

This is the research repository for MS3226: Partner abuse and sexual satisfaction among postmenopausal women. For more information scroll down through this page, or click on a link in the table of contents below. More information about the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) is available [here](https://www.whi.org/SitePages/WHI%20Home.aspx).

Building on prior work related to abuse exposure and functional outcomes in postmenopausal women (1,3), the primary aim of the proposed work is to investigate the cross-sectional relationship between self-reported recent (past-year) physical and verbal abuse and self-reported sexual satisfaction, among postmenopausal women enrolled in the WHI. Women in the OS and/or CT components (aged 50-79 years at baseline) who responded “yes” to item 129 on Form 37 (“Did you have any sexual activity with a partner in the last year”) at baseline will be included in analyses. Our hypotheses are as follows: 

1. Rates of global sexual dissatisfaction at baseline will be higher among women who report past-year abuse at baseline compared to women who did not; and 

2. Rates of sexual frequency dissatisfaction at baseline will be higher among women who report past-year abuse at baseline than among women who do not report baseline abuse. Descriptive analyses will characterize the directionality of sexual frequency satisfaction (i.e., desiring more/less frequency) by past-year abuse status, among sexually dissatisfied women at baseline.

A subsidiary aim is to conduct cross-sectional descriptive analyses to characterize sexual satisfaction (Global/Frequency) among women according to their recent abuse history and presence/absence of depression.
